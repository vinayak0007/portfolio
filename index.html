<div id="test">
  Our eye movements are often playing key roles while deciding response to stimulating environment. The human eye has a wide field of view but we can focus only in a certain region at a time in the space we see. When we read something written on a page, our eyes and brain coordinate to read and understand one word at a time. Overall, eye-tracking gives us the eye gaze behaviour.
<br><br>In my project I used eye-tracking to get the gaze plot of people reading medicines to analyse the reading behaviour in medicine labels. People often only get a fraction of the information printed on the medicine labels. The whole work was focussed to see whether the present information design in medicine labels and the regulations governing them are sufficient to deliver required information to the people as people in different age groups interacts with medicine labels in different ways. A need for better design of medicine labels was felt during the project.

Soft-Robotics is a branch of robotics which aims to make systems similar to living organisms with a focus to make movements as lucid and flexible as they are in real life. Smart materials have a huge role to play in this field in the coming days.<br><br><br> Our project was related to redistribution of air in inflatable columns so as to carry out specific shapes. The project started with designing of continuous and connected inflatable columns in which distribution of air could happen with help of some sensors being guided by Arduino. The prototype was able to take various shapes depending on the surrounding environment. Pneumatic solenoid valve were vital in distributing the air amongst the different inflatable columns. We are still working on it to improve its design and functionality.

  </div><br><img id="yo" src="img/portfolio/3small.png" align="left" height="100%">
<div id="test">
Gas nitriding is a hardening process where nitrogen is introduced in the surface of a solid ferrous metal allow by heating and holding the metal at a suitable temperature (650°C) while in contact with a nitrogenous gas, commonly ammonia. When ammonia comes into contact with the heated metal, it becomes nitrogen and hydrogen. The nitrogen then diffuses from the surface into the core of the material. Due to the comparatively low temperatures employed in this process, nitriding of steels produces less distortion and deformation than either carburizing or conventional hardening. A small amount of growth may occur as a result of gas nitriding but volumetric changes are minimal. Gaseous nitriding likely is the most widely employed thermochemical surface treatment by which tremendous improvement of the wear, fatigue and corrosion resistances of steel components can be realized.<br>Gas nitriding of Pure Fe and Fe-Mn (2% Mn) alloy was carried out at 650°C at different nitriding potentials resulting in formation of different nitride phases(ɛ,ϒ’) and ferrite(α). As expected the Fe-Mn sample prior to nitriding majorly exhibited ferrite(α) phase. The high potential nitrided sample exhibited larger thickness of ɛ-phase whereas the low potential nitrided sample exhibited smaller thickness of ɛ-phase.</div><br><br><br>

  </div><br><img id="yo" src="img/portfolio/8small''.png" align="left" height="100%">
<div id="test">
  SPLITTER, an android game is one of my projects with the Mobile Development Group, IITR. The idea was to create a 2D game which is easy to use but hard to master. These days 2D games are getting out of trend with the introduction of 3D games like PUBG but some 2D games like Angry Birds still find a way to attract game lovers.<br>
  Our project started with the characterisation of a space-ship that could split in case an obstacle comes in front. The difficulty level of the game increases with increase in the score of the player. 2D games still remain unique in the gaming industry because of the simplicity they provide. Thus, we had to bring out an easy-to-use interface for the game. A minimal gesture user interface which could be operated quickly was to be designed. Unity game engine became handy while developing the game. Bringing order in the game was at top of our priority to minimize time delay and making the process simple and efficient at the same time. At present, the game has a 4.7 rating with over 5k downloads. You can check it out on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdg.splitter"><font color="blue">Google Play</a></font>.

  </div><br><img id="yo" src="img/portfolio/4small.png" align="left" height="100%">
<div id="test">
  Conceptualized this project as a member of IITRMS (Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee Motorsports) group. I worked on this project in the power-train division during my sophomore years of my undergrad life. Though it could not get implemented in our car due to certain limitations of time, the conceptualization had given us ways for further work in this direction.<br><br>
Torque Vectoring is a technology applied to differentials used in automobiles (F1 student race car in this case). Differentials play a vital role in transferring torque to the wheels. This technique allows different torque being applied to different wheels at the same time which often becomes a deciding factor in turning while maintaining a good speed. Based on the Ackerman steering geometry, the torque vectoring algorithm provides unique solutions to variable wheel speeds. Torque Vectoring plays key role in neutral, under and over-steering cornering.

  </div><br><img id="yo" src="img/portfolio/5small.png" align="left" height="100%">
<div id="test">
The project was basically focused on analyzing human attention patterns while navigating through a virtual 3D map of an area. A 3D map of Salt Lake City, Kolkata was developed using Google Sketch Up. Participants were given eye-trackers with was further calibrated with their eye. The whole setup was to compare navigation in real world and the virtual environment. Human perceptions and experience often are deciding while finding ways. Several factors affect decision making such as source, destination, previous experience and our own preferences. Our main focus was to find the extent to which spatial positioning influence way-finding. During the experimentation, it was found that sometimes a path might be chosen to avoid discomfort (like to avoid traffic, noise etc.).  Participants were invited from different age groups, gender, financial groups to get better understanding of decision making while way-finding. After navigating through the virtual 3D map, participants were asked to draw a rough map of the area. They were asked various questions to check what information they have in their memory either consciously or subconsciously and their response time was also noted for further analysis.

Working as Intern in UI/UX division of PSTakeCare was a whole new experience for me in the first year summers. PSTakeCare are a young team of passionate graduates & college students from IIT Bombay and ICT backed by medical professionals and healthcare experts.<br><br> My task was to renovate the PSTakeCare website. A lot of hospitals were connected with the startup to cater better health facilities to patients but the operations were not shown on the website. Some of the surgeries offered by the startup were Bone & Joint surgeries, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Heart Disease, Eye surgery and Cancer Treatment. Therefore, my focus was to design an interface which would clearly state the operations and surgeries offered by the firm. We had to keep experience of user light while going through website despite of it being filled with surgery names. A lot of research was done to find a suitable theme for the website and think of possible sections in it followed by wire-framing and prototyping.

<div id="test">
<br>Logo and branding add another dimension to the identity of one’s creative work. This was my first project as a designer and I had enjoyed it thoroughly playing with shapes and colours. Logos are often used for stationery, website logos, business cards, or for watermarks. Personal logos are the artist’s own brand. I started with rough sketches on paper and afterwards used Adobe Illustrator to give it a digital form. Tinkering with pixels was quite fun, considering design can define everything around us.  I have tried to fuse 3 V’s in the logo and gave it a triangular shape.
